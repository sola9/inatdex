# inatdex
iNatdex is a real-life Pok√©dex using iNaturalist. It is meant for visualizing your progress on observing target taxa during a time period. It is very rudimentary and janky.

inatdex requires ijson, pyinaturalist, and pyqt6 to run. Install these with:
```pip install ijson
pip install pyinaturalist
pip install pyqt6```
<br>
With these installed, you should be able to run inatdex.py. Further details on using inatdex can be found in instructions.pdf
